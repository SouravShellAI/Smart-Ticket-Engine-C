# Smart-Ticket-Engine-C

> A high-performance Customer Support Ticketing System that bridges the gap between **low-level efficiency (C)** and **high-level web accessibility (Python/Flask)**. Designed to simulate real-world e-commerce support workflows with priority-based scheduling.

## Project Overview
In modern software engineering, speed and accessibility are paramount. This project demonstrates a **hybrid architecture**:
1.  **The Brain (C):** Handles heavy logic, data processing, priority queue management, and database (CSV) operations for maximum performance.
2.  **The Body (Python/Flask):** Provides a secure, responsive web interface for users and administrators to interact with the system.

This system allows users to raise tickets for product issues, tracks them via a unique ID, and allows Admins to resolve them based on algorithmic priority (Critical > High > Medium > Low).

---

## System Architecture

The project uses a **File-Based IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** model.

1.  **Frontend (HTML/CSS):** Captures user input (Tickets, Login).
2.  **Middleware (Flask):** Validates input (Regex/Blacklist) and writes raw data to `pending_tickets.csv`.
3.  **Backend Engine (C):** * Detects new entries in `pending_tickets.csv`.
    * Parses data and assigns **Priority** based on keywords (e.g., "Hacked" = Critical).
    * Moves processed data to the Main Database (`customer_support_tickets_updated.csv`).
4.  **Admin View:** The C program generates a real-time HTML Dashboard (`admin_view.html`) reflecting the current state of the Queue.

## Key Features

### User Panel
* **Secure Authentication:** User Signup/Login with input validation.
* **Ticket Creation:** detailed forms for Product, Date of Purchase, and Issue Description.
* **Real-Time Tracking:** Users can track status (Open/Resolved) using Ticket ID & Email.
* **Modern UI:** Responsive, with visual feedback.

### Admin Dashboard
* **Live Monitoring:** Auto-refreshing dashboard generated by C.
* **Priority Sorting:** Tickets are auto-sorted; Critical issues appear at the top.
* **One-Click Resolution:** Admins can mark tickets as resolved, moving them to the archival database.
* **Detailed Analytics:** View customer name, email, product, and issue date at a glance.

## Technical Highlights & Data Structures

This is not just a CRUD app; it implements core Computer Science concepts:

| Concept | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Priority Queue** | Implemented in **C** to sort tickets. Critical issues (Security/Money) are prioritized over cosmetic bugs. |
| **File Handling (I/O)** | robust CSV parsing in C to read, write, and update records without data corruption. |
| **Regex & Validation** | Python backend ensures username/email integrity and prevents injection attacks. |
| **Polling Mechanism** | The C backend runs a continuous loop (Daemon-like) to fetch and process new tickets instantly. |

## Security Measures

* **Input Sanitization:** Blocks HTML tags and special characters to prevent XSS.
* **Blacklist Logic:** Prevents spam usernames (e.g., "admin", "abc", "null") during signup.
* **Strict Pattern Matching:** Usernames must follow specific regex patterns (No numbers allowed, specific length).
* **Access Control:** Admin routes are protected; Users cannot access the Admin Dashboard without credentials.

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* GCC Compiler (MinGW for Windows, standard GCC for Linux/Mac)
* Python 3.x
* Pip (Python Package Manager)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Support-Hub.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Support-Hub.git)
cd Support-Hub

### Step 2: Compile the C Engine
The C program acts as the server's logic engine.

gcc main.c -o ticketing_engine
./ticketing_engine

# Keep this terminal open!

### Step 3: Run the Python Server
Open a new terminal window.

pip install flask
python server.py

### Step 4: Access the App
Open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

🚀 Future Improvements
Database Migration: Move from CSV to SQLite/PostgreSQL for scalability.

Email Notifications: Integrate SMTP to send email updates upon ticket resolution.

Chatbot Integration: AI-based initial support response.
